### Hey there!

My name is Tanner. I'm a graduate student studying marine geophysics at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Columbia University. My interests are centered around tectonic margins, the structure and evolution oceanic plates, and their associated natural hazards. I utilize various types of geophysical data, but specialize in using active source seismic and electromagnetic data to image the earth on a crustal scale. My current work focuses on the hazardous subduction zones offshore Alaska, Sumatra, Nicaragua, and Mexico. This also requires that I contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of tectonic plates prior to subduction. 

With two degrees in geophysics and 4+ years of experience using active source seismic data, I
